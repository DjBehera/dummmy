Their countries have professed a friendship “with no limits,’’ and on Wednesday top Chinese and Russian officials looked quite chummy during a meeting in Moscow, a sight likely to exacerbate concerns in Washington.

Wang Yi, China’s top diplomat, held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin the day after gathering with his head of security and saying relations between the nations are “solid as a rock.”

That's in sharp contrast to Wang's contentious meeting Saturday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who told him China supplying weapons to Russia would be a "serious problem'' for the U.S. as they also discussed the surveillance balloon incident that has heightened tensions between the two superpowers.

China has declined to join much of the world community in condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, instead echoing Moscow’s claim that the U.S. and NATO provoked the Kremlin and criticizing sanctions imposed on Russia. Chinese leader Xi Jinping is expected to visit Moscow in the coming months.

"Chinese-Russian relations have withstood the test of international turbulence, and are mature and durable,” Wang said Wednesday. 

The concern about those relations leading to Chinese military assistance for Russia go beyond such aid stacking the odds against Ukraine and into the possibility of the conflict escalating into a larger confrontation.

On Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told The Associated Press there have been "some signs'' China may be getting ready to provide weapons to Russia, while also saying the alliance will support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”
